This is the code and results of my Final year Univeristy project for my Bachelor Degree with Honours in Computer Science at Cardiff University. My project was to create an AI based Intrusion Detection System and test how effective it is against the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox(ART).

. The dataset I used was from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. The dataset used: Intrusion detection evaluation dataset (CIC-IDS2017).

. I used the Friday-02-03-2018 file which I edited, the changes I made were removing duplicate header rows which reappeared a couple times throughout the file.
I was unable to upload the file I used as it exceeded the size limit.
The file can be shared upon request.
